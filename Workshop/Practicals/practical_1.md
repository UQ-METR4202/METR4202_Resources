# METR4202
## Robotics & Automation
### Week 1: Practical - Intro to ROS

---

### In Summary...
- ROS stands for **R**obot **O**perating **S**ystem
- It is a middleware for communicating between processes that independently perform tasks for your robot stack (e.g., sensing, decision-making, acting)
- As robot developers you will use ROS as a library inside your Python or C++ code
- It is recommended to get comfortable with BASH (terminal) to run ROS commands during development (there is a cheat sheet in the METR4202 repository for your convenience)
